    "\n",
    "Can local markets affect the labor compensation of public sector workers? In Rebecca Diamond's paper \"Housing Supply Elasticity and Rent Extraction by State and Local Governments\", the author studies how the slope of a city's housing supply curve could influence the city government's taxation decisions and government expenditure choices. The paper presents evidence that the slope of a city's housing supply curve, which measures the responsiveness of housing supply to changes in demand, plays a significant role in determining the government's ability to extract rent from its citizens. If you're curious on the motivation behind the data analysis below, see [here](http://www.stanford.edu/~diamondr/gov_housing_supply.pdf). Note that the analysis below is NOT the same at that found in the paper. The estimates you find will NOT match. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this data task, we wish to study how the wage difference between workers employed by local governments differs from the wages paid to similarly qualified workers employed in the private sector. The data you will use to measure workers' wages comes from the Consumer Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups (CPS-MORG). This is a nationwide survey of US households conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which asks a variety of questions, including information about wage earnings, employment, and many demographics (age, race...). This is also the same dataset as in Project 2 but with different variables and for a different time range. "

The full documentation of the data can be found at: http://www.nber.org/morg/docs/cpsx.pdf. (This should look familiar!) This describes in detail all the variables in the data and exactly how each one is defined and coded.

We are using a sample here due to the memory restriction of Datahub. \n",

This records for each metropolitan area (msafips) a z-scored measure of land unavailability (`unaval`), which we will use as a proxy for housing market elasticity. Higher value (z-score) of land unavailability would imply the housing market is less elastic since there is not much land to build new housing. "
