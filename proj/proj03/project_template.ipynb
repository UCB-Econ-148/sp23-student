    "2. Good (80-90%): Work that is free of fundamental errors and demonstrates a basic understanding of what you're doing.\n",

That doesn't necessarily mean you made a mistake; it might just mean you needed more information.

There is a lot of flexibility here; if you have any doubt about whether your questions are distinct, consult with Peter, Yiyang, or Prof. Van Dusen."

It may be beneficial to compare a supervised model (e.g. regression, classification) to an unsupervised model (e.g. clustering).  \n",

This includes **feature choices** (e.g. why do you include these variables in the regression), **parameter choices** (e.g. how many folds in [k-fold cross validation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/), what time window you use for averaging your data, how many clusters in clustering) as well as **model form** (e.g., If you use LASSO, why?

Carefully describe your [model selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection) process (including [cross validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate.html) if any). If you are working on forecasting and prediction models (e.g. classification, time series models), you should partition your data into [training and testing sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets). The training data set is what you use for cross-validation (i.e. you sample from within it to create folds, etc.).  The testing data set is held to the very end of your efforts, and used to compare different models. This is also a great place to visualize how you've used the bias-variance tradeoff plot in your decision behind the complexity of your models.\n",

    "5. Seek opportunities to write functions that allow you to avoid doing things over and over, and that make your code more succinct and readable. This is especially helpful when you're deploying a multitude of models."
